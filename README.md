Android sliding menu

This sliding menu uses absolutely zero code, it is just a normal horizontal layout with a horizontal scrollview added

The images come from the now dead and buried WowZapp Android project - it may though be as wise to substitute your own in for these to avoid any possible copyright issues. I am using them here as the company behind WowZapp still owes me $12k, so I'm using these in partial payment.
